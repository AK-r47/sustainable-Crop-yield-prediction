# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction

This project predicts crop yield based on various input parameters such as temperature, rainfall, soil type, and fertilizer usage using machine learning regression techniques.

## 📌 Overview

Agriculture plays a vital role in any economy. Accurate crop yield prediction helps farmers, researchers, and policymakers to make data-driven decisions for better resource allocation, risk management, and food security planning.

This project implements a machine learning model trained on agricultural data to predict the expected yield of crops in a specific region.

## 🚀 Features

* Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Regression model training (e.g. Linear Regression, Random Forest)
* Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R² score
* User input interface (CLI or Web) for yield prediction
* Well-commented and modularized code for easy understanding

## 🗃️ Dataset

* **Source:** \[Insert dataset source here – e.g. Kaggle Crop Yield dataset or Government Open Data]
* **Attributes:** Year, State/Region, Crop type, Area, Production, Rainfall, Temperature, Soil Type, Fertilizer use, etc.

> **Note:** The dataset was cleaned for missing values and outliers before training.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, scikit-learn
* **Optional:** Flask/Streamlit for deployment

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-yield-prediction.git
   cd crop-yield-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python crop_yield_prediction.py
   ```

4. For web deployment (if implemented):

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📊 Results

* **Best model:** Random Forest Regressor
* **R² Score:** 0.89
* **RMSE:** 45 kg/ha

*(Modify these based on your results)*

## 📈 Future Work

* Include real-time weather API integration
* Expand to multi-crop and multi-region models
* Develop a user-friendly mobile application for farmers
